This project uses the Brawl Stars API to collect player information and display key statistics such as total trophies, progress, and profile data. I used Python to send API requests, retrieve structured data, and process responses in JSON format. The project helped me understand how APIs work, how real data is collected, and how it can be prepared for basic analysis. As a Brawl Stars player (in the past =), I was curious to explore my favorite game statistics and it made this project both technical and personal.
